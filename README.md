**What is SCM?**
Software Configuration Management (SCM) helps developers in tracking, controlling, and organizing changes in software projects. It encompasses version control, build management, and change management, ensuring that all modifications, such as bug fixes, new features, or documentation updates—are recorded in a systematic way. By maintaining a comprehensive history of what changed, who changed it, and why, SCM helps teams collaborate more effectively and reduces confusion about the state of the codebase. Additionally, SCM practices allow developers to roll back to previous versions when issues arise, making it easier to debug problems and maintain overall project quality. In larger projects, SCM also facilitates auditing and compliance by providing a clear, chronological record of all code-related activities.

**How GitHub Helps:**
GitHub is a popular web-based platform built on top of the Git version control system. It offers an intuitive interface that simplifies many SCM tasks and provides additional collaboration features. By hosting code in GitHub repositories, developers can easily manage branches for different features or bug fixes, keeping experimental work separate from stable code. When changes are ready to be reviewed, GitHub’s Pull Request system allows team members to discuss code, leave feedback, and run automated tests before merging those changes back into the main branch. This workflow not only ensures code quality but also fosters a culture of collective ownership and continuous learning.
